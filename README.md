# Todo List (SDLC Practice App)

## Goal
Ship a minimal tasks app that covers the full SDLC: requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

## Scope (v1)
- Create a task (title required, optional due date)
- Toggle done/not done
- Filter tasks (All / Open / Done)
- Persist tasks between refreshes

## Out of Scope (v1)
- Authentication, sharing, reminders, tags, search, mobile app

## Success Metrics
- App supports add/toggle/filter + persistence
- Minimum 5 automated tests passing
- Deployed (URL or reproducible Docker run)

## Timeline
- v1 delivered in 3–7 days

## Roles (single-person simulation)
- PM: scope, milestones, acceptance criteria
- Dev: build features
- QA: test plan + test execution
- DevOps: deploy + release notes
